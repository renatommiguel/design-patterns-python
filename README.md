## MVC
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern serves as the basis for software architecture that will be easily maintained and modified.

The main idea of MVC is about separating an application into three parts: model, view, and controller. There is an easy way to understand MVCâ€”the model is the data and its business logic, the view is the window on the screen, and the controller is the glue between the two.
